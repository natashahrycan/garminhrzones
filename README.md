# Garmin HR zones
Python script to visualize the usual Heart Rate plot from your Garmin, but color coded according to the 5 HR zones.

This project used the TCX files, available to download from the Activities section in Garmin Connect. Since Garmin only shows a plain coloured data field when displaying HR, cadence, etc., I considered it could be more useful to visualize the zones in the very same HR graphic.

The code also includes how to transform our TCX file into a more understandable data frame.

Aditionally, if you want to take a look at your elevation and your HR at the same time, you can assign a color map for the dots that make up your plot.
